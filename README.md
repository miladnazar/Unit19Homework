# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python
I'm using my Python skills to generate a HD Wallet that includes btc, eth and bitcoin testnet all in one place. First of all, I start downloading and installing the required dependencies such as the following:
- PHP 
-hd-wallet-derive 
-bit 
-web3.py

**Now I'm able to write my functions to build the multi-coin wallet consisting of btc, eth and bitcoin testnet. I did this mostly in Visual Studio and Terminal and I was able to print out the details of each coin in my wallet.** *Here is a screenshot for it.*
